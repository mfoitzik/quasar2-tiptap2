# Quasar2-TipTap2

Basic WYSIWYG Editor using Quasar 2 / Vue 3 / TipTap 2 Configured for Typescript and Vue's Composition API

## Demo
You can view a demo at [https://www.simplicityblocks.com/quasar2tiptap2]

## What this project does
This project basically implements the basic examples that are on the TipTap site at [https://www.tiptap.dev/examples/default] within a Quasar Framework project.

The project uses Vue 3, the composition API and Typescript.

I have added a few custom extensions to provide the capability of Font Color, Font Size and Font Background Color.

This is just meant to be a starter.

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
To get this to work I had to add a resolutions property to the package.json file telling it to use vue 3.1.4. Because of this I believe you need to use yarn instead of npm to install the dependencies (I do not think that npm looks at the resolutions property). Without adding this the editor was not displaying.

## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfoitzik/quasar2-tiptap2.git
```

### Install the dependencies (use yarn!)
```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the dev server
```bash
quasar dev
```
