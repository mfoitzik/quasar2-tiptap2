          This is still the text editor you’re used to, but enriched with node views.

          <p>This is editable.</p>

<p>Basic WYSIWYG Editor using TQuasar 2 / Vue 3 / TipTap 2 Configured for Typescript and Vue's Composition API</p>
<h4>What this project does</h4>


<p>This project basically implements the basic examples that are on the TipTap site at [<a href="https://www.tiptap.dev/examples/default">https://www.tiptap.dev/examples/default</a>] within a Quasar Framework project.</p>
<p>I have added a few custom extensions to provide the capability of Font Color, Font Size and Font Background Color.</p>
<p>This is just meant to be a starter.</p>
<h4>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h4>
<p>To get this to work I had to add a resolutions property to the package.json file telling it to use vue 3.1.4. Because of this I believe you need to use yarn instead of npm to install the dependencies (I do not think that npm looks at the resolutions property). Without adding this the editor was not displaying.</p>
<h4>Clone the repository</h4>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">git clone https://github.com/mfoitzik/quasar2-tiptap2.git</code></pre>
<h5>Install the dependencies (use yarn!)</h5>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">yarn install</code></pre>
<h5>Start the dev server</h5>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">quasar dev</code></pre>
